                <h3>Mental Models for Python</h3>
                <p>
                    Not aiming at a list of generic programming concepts. Difference between concept and mental model?
                    Don't know, don't think there is one. Purpose of this article isn't cover what would be learned in
                    a Python course or tutorial. These concepts lurk under the surface and you can get away without
                    knowing them, but if you do know them, my hope is that it makes you a better programmer.

                    It's a list, which means it's never finished, will add to over time.

                    Things about to get pretty meta so hold on tight.
                    (The idea of building a mental model for how your code works, or how other peoples code works).
                    When you approach learning someone elses code, your goal is not to memorise exactly what is happening,
                    but to build an intuition for what the moving pieces are.
