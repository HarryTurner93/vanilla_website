                <p>
                    Hi, I'm Harry, I'm a machine learning engineer at work, and
                    a tinkerer at home. I'll do any project that looks like fun or if I think
                    there's something to be learned from it. I also read a lot. The tech world can be exhausting,
                    so to relax I get out into nature as much as I can, either on my gravel bike
                    (who needs roads), or under the water in the UK coasts and quarries.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I work at <a href="https://www.rovco.com/">Rovco</a>, a rapidly growing tech company in the
                    off-shore renewables industry. Essentially an ROV (Remotely Operated Vehicle) and hydrographic
                    survey company, but with a very strong R&D arm in 3D, AI, and autonomous robotics.
                    I get to work on real problems in computer vision and robotics,
                    where my work has a positive impact on the planet (95% of our business is in offshore wind).
                </p>

                    This website isn't just a blog, it's a journal, a living document that I'll revisit and rewrite again
                    and again. It's somewhere I can keep all my thoughts and ideas, somewhere to keep track of my
                    progress, somewhere to reflect and write down things I've learned along the way. Although I'm doing it for me, I'm making it public in case anything here is of
                    use to somebody else.
