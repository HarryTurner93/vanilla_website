                    <h5>The Black Swan</h5>
                    <p><i>Nassim Nicholas Taleb</i></p>
                    <p>
                        Read because I liked his first one, Fooled by Randomness. (I've actually read this a few times now).
                        The book is about one central idea, that there is a class of events that are rare but have disproportionate
                        impact (positive or negative), and that they are fundamentally unpredictable. Despite the simple message, it's one
                        of those books where every page is packed with insights. What I like the most is that it's slightly mathematical,
                        slightly philosophical, and (to be honest) quite rambling and unstructured, but for that's a positive, it makes
                        it fun to read.

                    <h5>The Places Inbetween</h5>
                    <p><i>Rory Stewart</i></p>
                    <p>
                        An eye-opening description of his walk across Afghanistan. A raw, and honest view of rural
                        Afghan life. It's not a description of a sightseeing or backpacking holiday; no hostels,
                        no airbnb, no shops or cafes. What I found most incredible was how every night he finds a village and the hosts take
                        him in (most of the time), feed him, provide him (some) shelter, and talk and share their lives with him. They
                        provide stories of their ancestory and past, send their sons to guide him over the snowy mountains to the next village 20 miles away,
                        and generally welcome him to their homes (often dry mud huts) all because he's a guest in their valley. Imagine
                        trying that in the UK... For me it was a stark insight into what life was probably like hundreds of years ago. I bet
                        life was a bit more personable and human back then.

                    <h5>Economics in One Lesson</h5>
                    <p><i>Henry Hazlitt</i></p>
                    <p>
                        A good introduction to some fundamental economic principles and mental models in economics,
                        the main one being that whatever policy is implemented, you must consider effects on all parties, not
                        just the most vocal one, and secondary effects over time, not just the immediate ones. This won't make you a
                        master in economics but it will equip you with the mental models that will help you to reason
                        intelligently about many of the political and economic problems we have today.

                    <h5>12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos</h5>
                    <p><i>Jordan Peterson</i></p>
                    <p>
                        This book is what I thought 21 Lessons would be. Both authors build on
                        the same set of ideas (human cooperation through shared belief systems), Yuval's books lay
                        the groundwork by introducing human history, how those belief systems have evolved in the 75,000
                        years humans have been around, and does a great job of explaining why we are where we are today. It
                        also expands your horizons as to what the next few decades might be like. On the other hand, 12 Rules for Life
                        offers a very practical set of guidelines on what to actually do about it. I found it much more accessible after
                        reading Yuval Harari, in that framework this book would fit into the libertarian take on the meaning of life
                        (the one I most identify with). Biggest takeaway? Humans need order, rules, and values, but too much
                        order isn't a good thing either. The path to the good life is the one that treads a fine line between the two.

                    <h5>21 Lessons for the 21st Century</h5>
                    <p><i>Yuval Noah Harari</i></p>
                    <p>
                        Before you read this, read Sapiens first, followed by Homo Deus, by the same author.
                        If Sapiens is past, and Homo Deus is future, this book considers the present and why we need to think
                        seriously about where humanity is heading. I learned a lot about why humanity is the way it is today.
                        I also found it shocking, and the whole book has shaken up my view of the world, but
                        that's probably a good thing. Biggest takeaway? A real sense of urgency. It's now more important
                        than ever for me (everyone) to figure out who we are, and who we want to be in the 21st Century.

                    <h5>Fooled By Randomness</h5>
                    <p><i>Nassim Nicholas Taleb</i></p>
                    <p>
                        This was a re-read from a long time ago, but I hadn't started keeping track of books then.
                        It's about randomness in every day life, and why we understand and appreciate it less than we should. The
                        book is essentially a guide to being fooled by randomness as little as possible. It's one of those books
                        where every page is packed with insights, and although the content is a bit all over the place (the author self
                        describes the book as a collection of essays), I found I liked the style. Biggest takeaway was to always
                        try and be aware of the histories that didn't take place, which is harder than you think.

                    <h5>Creative Blindness</h5>
                    <p><i>Dave Trott</i></p>
                    <p>
                        I read this because I like Dave's other books, One + One = Three and Predatory Thinking.
                        All Dave's books are collections of anecdotes, each with an important
                        lesson to learn. In this book, those lessons are mostly on creativity. It was enjoyable to read and
                        I recorded a list of ten or so new ideas or principles that I think will be helpful for life in general.
                        I won't share them all here, (honestly, read the book yourself, you'll get more out of it), however the one I liked
                        the most was; creative solutions are <i>usually</i> the combination of two separate and unrelated problems
                        where somebody had the insight to spot the connection. The book is basically a long list of examples of that rule.
