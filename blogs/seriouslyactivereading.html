                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    What is this article all about and why should you read it? Active reading (in contrast with
                    passive reading) is the process of trying to actively remember what you read by engaging with
                    the material as you read it. More often than not that means taking notes, pausing regularly to reflect and
                    connect the ideas with your other experiences, and following up with the information afterwards
                    using techniques like spaced repetition. The advantage of doing this is obvious, you learn more
                    and remember more of it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately though, active reading takes a lot of
                    effort, and you simply can't apply it to everything you read, it'd be too exhausting. But there are
                    certainly occasions where you do want to really absorb and assimilate the material, and it's
                    nice to have this "turbo mode" that you can switch on and off as and when you need it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This article is a tutorial in my system for extracting as much value as possible from the
                    material, remembering it, and then applying it in my life. I wanted to share it here as I've been
                    asked about it a few times and it's useful to have somewhere to direct people to.
                    This system is a variation of other reading systems out there that I have personalised and made
                    work for me, I hope you find some of the ideas useful. Here's a quick summary of how my
                    system works, then I'll go through each part in more detail with an example case study.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In short, my system boils down to extracting mental models, principles, and tools. I add these
                    to three growing lists respectively, and have adopted the habit of regularly reviewing those
                    lists (which is my version of spaced repetition). That's it.
                </p>
                <h3>Mental Models</h3>
                <p>

                </p>
                <h3>Principles</h3>
                <p>
                    A principle is the term I give to the little rules of thumb that you end up collecting over your
                    lifetime, the proverbial fatherly wisdom handed down through the generations. They are almost
                    like rules, but tend to be rather more abstract and general. You can think of them simply as bits
                    of general purpose advice. The goal of a principle is to
                    provide guidance in decision making, particularly in deciding how to act and behave in various
                    situations. It's easier to explain with a few examples.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>Prioritise Foundational Skills.</code> This is a principle for helping me decide what to
                    learn, because there's far too much for learn for one lifetime. This principle reminds me that
                    programming frameworks and languages come and go but that by mastering the underlying concepts and
                    ideas beneath those frameworks is more enduring. No doubt you've heard similar advice before,
                    this is my way of encoding and remembering it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>Affordable Loss Principle.</code> This principle dictates that I find ways to accomplish what
                    I want to do with the minimal possible expenditure of effort. Taking a product to market? Skip the
                    market research and analysis, go try and sell the thing instead. I'll learn much more!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <code>If You Don't Ask You Don't Get.</code> I'm sure that I don't need to explain this one,
                    but it's so true and I've found value in reminding myself of it regularly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can find lists and lists of these all over the internet, usually from articles
                    named things like "50 Lessons for life", or "The Best Advice My Dad Ever Gave Me". Although these are
                    good places to start, I've found it more effective to build my own list with those that are the
                    most meaningful to me, it grows over time. The most valuable place I pick up new principles now
                    is from reading blogs and articles from insightful writers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You do have to be careful of the level at which you collect them, otherwise you may end up with far
                    too many. For example, "Wake up at 7am" probably isn't a principle worth keeping in your list,
                    however perhaps "Keep a consistent sleeping routine" is more appropriate, it depends on what's
                    important and useful to you.

                    Why mental models, principles and tools? What are they?

                <p>
                    This is going to be a case study in using mental models, principles, and tools to learn
                    much more actively. I didn't come up with those things, But I do have a system for doing it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What are mental models, principles, and tools? Explanation of why I adopted this system, how the system works:
                    saving them in Evernote, reviewing them regularly, because I never revisited notes ever.

                    Lots more here that I haven't figured out. There's a practicing piece, long term memory.
