                <h1>On Not Burning Out</h1>
                <p><i>11th January 2021</i></p>
                <p>
                    This is a short story of my personal experience as a reminder that balance in life is important.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I deliberately called this post On <i><b>Not</b></i> Burning Out, because I don't believe I have
                    ever fully burned out. But I have come close several times, and recently it happened again. I am
                    very lucky because it served as a stark reminder that I need to keep things in balance, and it's
                    only now that I have the time to think about and appreciate the lesson, that I realise how important it
                    really is. It's so important, that I'm writing this post as a reminder, mostly for future me, but
                    also for others as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am not a psychologist. I am not a mental health expert. I am not qualified to tell you how to
                    live your life. I'm just one person who's slowly understanding the value of balance, and I hope I can
                    inspire you to do the same.
                </p>
