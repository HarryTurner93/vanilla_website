                <h1>On Not Burning Out</h1>
                <p><i>11th January 2021</i></p>
                <p>
                    This is a short story of my personal experience. It is a reminder that balance in life is important.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I deliberately called this post On <i><b>Not</b></i> Burning Out, because I don't believe I have
                    ever fully burned out. But I have come close several times, and recently it happened again. Despite
                    the experience being a stressful one, I consider myself lucky, because it served as a stark reminder
                    that I need to keep things in balance, and it's only now that I have the time to think about and
                    appreciate the lesson, that I realise how important it really is. It's so important, that I'm
                    writing this post as a reminder, mostly for future me, but for others as well. We could all do
                    with such a reminder every now and again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I, like a lot of people, like to be ambitious and sometimes bite off a bit more than I can chew.
                    Last year was one of those times, and for the 9 months from March to December 2020, I slowly
                    committed to more and more, and increased my involvement in those commitments. It's not important
                    what those commitments are, but they weren't just commitments of my time and energy. They were
                    commitments to taking responsibility for things, and those can be some of the most intensive
                    commitments of all.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At the end of November, it was beginning to burn me out, and things were beginning to slip. The
                    funny thing about committing is that when it's all going smoothly, you have the
                    illusion of control, but when just one commitment starts to become volatile, you quickly realise
                    how <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/07/05/Too-Efficient">little capacity</a>
                    you have to absorb that volatility. One of my biggest commitments unexpectedly blew up in my face,
                    and because I was so invested, I had no choice but to stick it out - at the expense of everything
                    else. My mental health suffered, and my energy and enthusiasm took a dive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fortunately, the christmas break forced a natural pause in most (but not all) of my commitments. I
                    was surprised by how long it took me to recover. I was surprised by how long it took me to recover,
                    I didn't bounce back in the space of a few days, I went through several stages of recovery before
                    I began feeling like myself again. I slowed the pace right down and it gave me time
                    to think and reflect on what had happened.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Benefits. An opportunity to grow up. Simply slowing down and reflecting on my experience, I discovered
                    something remarkable. I've noticed I've become more thoughtful, I have more ideas. I suspect it's
                    because I'm giving them space to appear, more ideas benefits all my commitments, I am more creative.
                    I found I had more patience for people, more compassion. I rediscovered that
                    the purpose of my life is not simply to <a href="https://longreads.com/2020/09/08/out-there-on-not-finishing/">produce and achieve</a>
                    as much as I can, at some point I should
                    probably enjoy myself along the way, otherwise what am I doing it all for? The funny thing is,
                    when you're racing at a hundred miles an hour, you simply don't have time to remind yourself of such
                    things, when those are precisely the things you need reminding of most. I can read books slowly, and
                    dive more deeply into ideas that interest me.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Prompt: Think about it a lot, means it's important or at least popping up a lot. Add principle
                    and reference other post. What have I noticed? more thoughtful, more ideas, (give them more space to appear),
                    more balance, more patience for people, less hate, more compassionate. more time to do things that compound, like meditate,
                    be grateful, exercise, read. Personal battles against not producing enough, helps to write it down. REmind myself
                    regularly that producing is not what it's all about, which can only do with more down time. Want to dive more
                    deeply into topics and not be superficial, read books slowly.
                </p>

                    I am not a psychologist. I am not a mental health expert. I am not qualified to tell you how to
                    live your life. I'm just one person who's slowly understanding the value of balance, and I hope I can
                    inspire you to do the same.
