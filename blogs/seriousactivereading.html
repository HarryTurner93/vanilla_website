                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    What is this article all about and why should you care? Active reading (in contrast with
                    passive reading) is the process of trying to actively remember what we read by engaging with
                    the material as we read it. More often than not that means taking notes, pausing regularly to reflect and
                    connect the ideas with our other experiences, and following up with the information afterward
                    using techniques like spaced repetition. The advantage of doing this is obvious, we learn more
                    and remember more of it, who doesn't want that!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, active reading takes a lot of
                    effort, and we simply can't apply it to everything we read, it'd be too exhausting. But there are
                    certainly occasions where we do want to really absorb and assimilate the material, and it's
                    nice to have this "turbo mode" that we can switch on and off as and when we need it. Ideally,
                    we want our turbo mode to be as effective and efficient as possible so that we're maximising the
                    amount of value we get out of reading a particular piece. These methods are sometimes
                    called <a href="https://whytoread.com/how-to-read-simple-reading-strategies-read-effectively/">
                    Reading Strategies</a>, or Reading Systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This article is a tutorial in my system for extracting as much value as possible from the
                    material, remembering it, and then applying it in my life. I wanted to share it here as I've been
                    asked about it a few times and it's useful to have somewhere to direct people to.
                    This system is a variation of other reading strategies out there that I have personalised and made
                    my own, I hope you find some of the ideas useful. Here's a quick summary of how my
                    system works, then I'll go through each part in more detail with an example case study.
                </p>
                <h3>My Reading System</h3>
                <p>
                    First I decide whether or not the thing I'm reading or watching is something I really want to learn
                    and remember, in other words, I decide whether or not to turn on turbo-mode. If I do, then
                    I specifically look out for and extract mental models, principles, and tools. I add these to three
                    growing lists respectively, that I store in Evernote. Finally, I have adopted the habit of regularly
                    reviewing those lists (which is my version of spaced repetition), to help me remember and embed
                    those ideas into everyday life. That's it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now I'll go through each of those pieces in turn.
                </p>
                <h3>Mental Models</h3>
                <p>
                    Mental models are concepts or ideas about how something works, they're how we understand the world.
                    The real world is far too complex for us to hold all the tiny details in our minds, so we use models to
                    simplify that complexity, whether we realise it or not. Let me give you a few examples.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="http://www.defmacro.org/2013/09/26/products.html">The Three Bucket Model.</a>
                    This is a mental model for thinking about product management in
                    software projects. It says that product features can be grouped into three categories. The first is
                    Game Changers which are features that make people buy your product, they're new, novel, and solve
                    a frustrating problem. The second category of features is Show-Stoppers, which won't make people
                    buy your product, but will stop them from buying it if they're not there. The third category of
                    features is Distractors which are irrelevant and don't affect a buy decision. The reality is
                    obviously more nuanced than this, but as a simplifying model, this way of thinking is surprisingly
                    effective and helps me triage what features should be built first. Note that it doesn't
                    tell me what to do, it just helps me think more effectively about the problem. In a minute I'll
                    cover principles which tell me what to do. If I combine a popular principle such as
                    <i>Double down on your strengths</i> with the <i>Three Bucket Model</i>, it tells me to prioritise the
                    features that make my product stand out at all costs, whilst patching the show-stoppers sufficiently
                    enough that they don't stop sales.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://alexw.substack.com/p/information-compression">Information Compression.</a>
                    This is a model for thinking about communication between two people. It says that an idea may
                    exist in the head of Person A, but when they try to communicate that idea to person B it has to
                    pass through a bottleneck which is human language, and all the nuance and complexity of the idea
                    is lost, which often means person B ends up not fully understanding the idea and may end up solving
                    the wrong problem. When we understand this, we can either make sure we're communicating more of our
                    idea or ensure that we're communicating the most important parts of the idea, which is effectively
                    a better information compression. The article is well worth a read if that idea sounds interesting
                    to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most mental models appear in a particular domain, the Three Bucket Model is targetted at software
                    product management for example. But some models are more widely applicable, and if you can map
                    the concept into different areas of your life then the model may be called a general model.
                    For example, we could try and apply the Three Bucket model to
                    cooking recipes, or even ourselves, in that case, we would consider what skills we had that make us
                    stand out, those are the game-changers. What weaknesses will stop us from getting the jobs we want?
                    Those are the show-stoppers. The model helps us understand that we need to patch our weaknesses
                    sufficiently to prevent them from becoming show-stoppers, but after that, we should probably double
                    down on our strengths if we want to stand out from the other applicants.

                <h3>Principles</h3>
                <p>
                    A principle is a term I give to the little rules of thumb that I've collected throughout my
                    lifetime, the proverbial fatherly wisdom handed down through the generations. They are almost
                    like rules but tend to be rather more abstract and general. You can think of them simply as bits
                    of general-purpose advice. The goal of a principle is to guide decision making,
                    particularly in deciding how to act and behave in various situations. Let me explain with a
                    few examples.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Prioritise Foundational Skills.</i> This is a principle for helping me decide what to
                    learn because there's far too much to learn for one lifetime. This principle reminds me that
                    programming frameworks and languages come and go but that mastering the underlying concepts and
                    ideas beneath those frameworks is more enduring. No doubt you've heard similar advice before,
                    this is my way of encoding and remembering it. Notice how it's more of a directive, rather than
                    a model for thinking about the world. This is the main difference between mental models and
                    principles.

                    <a href="https://www.effectuation.org/sites/default/files/research_papers/what-makes-entrepreneurs-entrepreneurial-sarasvathy_0.pdf">Affordable Loss Principle.</a>
                    I discovered this one whilst reading the article, <i>What Makes Entrepreneurs Entrepreneurial?</i>
                    It dictates that a good way of testing your product, or idea, is to simply try it out, and do so as
                    cheaply as possible. For example, just go and try to sell your product to see if it sells, post
                    your blog post to see if people like it. You'll learn a lot more this way. The idea is that
                    working hard to make everything perfect and putting all the pieces in place before you "go live", is
                    likely not as effective as simply going for it and adapting as you go. Note that this works well
                    for entrepreneurs, probably less well for something like aircraft design, but there is a skill in
                    knowing when to apply which principles. Also, note that I call it the Affordable Loss Principle
                    because that's how it's known in the literature, the principle itself says to find ways to accomplish what
                    you want to do with the minimal possible expenditure of effort, which is a directive, so it does
                    feel like a principle rather than a mental model under my definitions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can find lists and lists of principles all over the internet, usually from articles
                    named things like "50 Lessons for life", or "The Best Advice My Dad Ever Gave Me". Although these are
                    good places to start, I've found it more effective to build my list with those that are the
                    most meaningful to me, it grows over time. The most valuable place I pick up new principles now
                    is from reading blogs and articles from insightful writers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You do have to be careful of the level at which you collect them, otherwise, you may end up with far
                    too many. For example, "Wake up at 7 am" probably isn't a principle worth keeping in your list,
                    however perhaps "Keep a consistent sleeping routine" is more appropriate, it depends on what's
                    important and useful to you.
                </p>
                <h3>Tools</h3>
                <p>
                    Tools are mental devices that you can use and deploy to achieve a particular result, just like you
                    would a real tool. Examples include step-by-step procedures for acting in particular situations or particular
                    diagrams you might draw to help you think about an idea. I'll give a few examples.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.sja.org.uk/get-advice/first-aid-advice/how-to/how-to-do-the-primary-survey/">Dr ABC.</a>
                    This is a classic tool for remembering what to do when you come across someone
                    in need of medical assistance. It's a mnemonic device that teaches you to first assess the Danger, then
                    try to elicit a Response, then if no response, check for Airway, Breathing, and Circulation. I
                    don't personally keep this tool in my list, but it's been drilled into me so many times as a kid
                    that it's the first example that popped into my mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <a href="https://barehands.substack.com/p/how-to-take-meeting-notes">A Process for Writing Meeting Notes.</a>
                    Here is a tool that you might use more often, I came
                    across the article a few months ago. It describes a process for capturing meeting notes that
                    goes like this. During the meeting, don't take notes, pay absolute attention to what your partner
                    is saying. Afterward, when you get home, start writing notes. Begin with a flow of consciousness
                    and use environmental clues to jog your memory. When that dries up, start mind-mapping, that usually
                    helps you remember a few more pieces. Next, draw a picture of the other person (seriously), the
                    switch to a different medium and way of thinking jogs yet more memories. Next add a time-line of
                    the conversation, that usually dislodges yet a few more, finally write it all up. I'll admit that I don't
                    do this yet, it's a lot of effort, but I know it's there and I've captured it in my list of
                    tools. It's something I may experiment with in the future.
                </p>
                <h3>Regular Review</h3>
                <p>
                    I have always struggled with scheduling regular sessions for reviewing notes, but I've read
                    time and again that if you want to remember it for good, then that's what you need to do. I
                    believe that the mental models, principles, and tools I'm collecting are really valuable, and if I end
                    up in one of those situations where they may be useful, I want them to come to mind quickly and
                    automatically, I don't want to have to say, <i>hang on a minute</i> and get my phone out and start
                    scrolling through the list to find the most relevant one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So it's not good enough to simply have a list of them, I need to know them by heart, I need to
                    live and breathe them, so if I'm going to use spaced repetiton on at least one thing, it might
                    as well be these lists.
                    So that's what I do, the only repetition I do is to go over those lists, I spend a least a little
                    bit of time each day just reading those lists. Specifically, I glance at the name of the model
                    or principle and then try and explain it to myself with an example, then check if I'm correct, and I try and use
                    different examples each time. It surprised me how quickly they become internalised and I've
                    started noticing in my conversations with people that the right ones are starting to pop up, and I'll
                    say, <i>ah yes, that's like this idea</i>, or <i>oh that's like this thing, we can think of this
                    problem this way</i>, etc. I'm starting to believe that this process works.
                </p>
                <h3>A Worked Example</h3>
                <p>
                    To tie everything together, I want to take you through an example of how I used this process
                    during a short training course on Problem Solving that I attended recently at work.
                    The course was only an hour-long, which is about as much time as I can deeply concentrate for, and
                    trust me, this process requires deep concentration. The course was split into four sections.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Introduction to Problem Solving</p></li>
                    <li><p>Working Through the Problem</p></li>
                    <li><p>Problem Solving Tools</p></li>
                    <li><p>Practice Problem Solving</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    As a side note, the nice thing about structured training courses like this one is that they're usually
                    designed so that each section has one main idea or concept behind it. The course designer
                    may not be consciously thinking about whether or not that idea is a principle or mental model or tool, but
                    it doesn't matter, it makes it easy for me to pick up. The general format for this course was that
                    each section was broken down into a set of short lessons, each a couple of minutes long.
                    Each lesson usually made one major point, and then the rest of the lesson contained several
                    examples elaborating that point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My method therefore involved paying close attention during the first minute or so of the lesson to
                    pick out the model or principle, and then filling in any additional useful commentary whilst
                    watching that idea be applied in practice.
                </p>

                    it's not a public course, I don't want to infringe on any copyright. My goal here is to show you
                    how I watch such a course and extract valuable ideas from it, <i>not</i> to teach you problem solving.

                    copied anything concrete from the course itself.

                </ul>
                <p>
                    <b>The Importance of Problem Solving.</b> The first lesson was a sales pitch on why I
                    should take the rest of the course, it said that rushing off to solve problems without thinking
                    usually leads to solving the wrong problem and wasting time, so it pays to think critically about
                    the problem first. I know all this, it's why I'm doing the course in the first place, so nothing
                    to extract here.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Causes vs Consequences.</b> The second lesson dived straight into actionable
                    advice, this immediately screamed Principles! The instructor made two points, you must ensure
                    you understand the root cause of the problem, not the superficial one you may be starting with.
                    Secondly, ensure you understand the consequences of taking a particular action. What sequence
                    of events could unfold as a result of you implementing your solution.
                    These points were explained in the first thirty seconds of the lesson, and
                    then the remainder developed the ideas with several examples and more information. Perfect I thought, there are two
                    problem solving principles here. 1. <i>Evaluate the Root Cause</i>, and 2. <i>Consider the Consequences</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Breaking Problems Down</b> The last lesson of the section followed the same pattern, the first
                    thirty seconds just said break the problem down, but then the instructor followed it up
                    with several examples. At first, it felt like another principle, but when they stepped
                    through the example it felt more like a variation of <i>Evaluate the Root Cause</i>. Splitting
                    your big problem in two was reflecting the fact that the problem was influenced by these two
                    smaller causes. So I didn't add a new principle, I expanded the definition of <i>Evaluate the
                    Root Cause</i> to include the need for breaking the problem down into pieces.
                </p>
                <h3>Working Through the Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    Section 2 was made up of the following parts.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Understand the Problem</p></li>
                    <li><p>Ask the Question Behind the Question</p></li>
                    <li><p>Look at What was Done Previously</p></li>
                    <li><p>Consider Multiple Points of View</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <b>Understand the Problem</b>. The instructor made one point here, you need to understand
                    the problem before you go off and solve it, and the best way to do that is to write a problem statement.
                    A quick google search shows a generic problem statement consists of the goal, boundaries, success criteria, assumptions, stakeholders, and timelines.
                    There was a lot of useful stuff to unpack here. First, I extracted a new principle, 3. <i>Understand
                    the Problem</i>. You could argue this is the same as <i>Evaluate the Root Cause</i>, but it felt
                    different, to me, this one is about making sure you're quantifying what it means to solve your problem, not necessarily
                    identifying the actual cause of the problem. I added a tool as well, the Problem Statement, because the way
                    it was presented in the lesson felt like a step by step process. It was a checklist to follow. I created
                    a tool called the Problem Statement that involves answering the questions.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>What is the goal?</p></li>
                    <li><p>How do you know you've solved the problem? (Success Criteria)</p></li>
                    <li><p>What are your assumptions?</p></li>
                    <li><p>Who are the stakeholders?</p></li>
                    <li><p>By when does this need to be solved?</p></li>
                    <li><p>What is and is not in scope?</p></li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    <b>Ask the Question Behind the Question.</b> In this lesson, the instructor started by describing the tendency
                    for us to rush off and start solving a problem the moment a co-worker asks us something. Here's my example,
                    imagine you get asked <i>Can you dig out those reports on our last quarter sales projections for me please?</i>
                    Or something along those lines. How many of us just rush off and do it? Whereas if you ask them
                    <i>why</i> they want those particular reports, you might find out that what they really need isn't
                    the reports themselves but that they've been tasked with collecting all the sales reports into the same
                    place to keep the business organised. But what they don't know is that you've already done this for all
                    the reports in your department and therefore can save them a lot of time. In other words, you know
                    something that they don't, which you could exploit to save everybody some effort if only you understood
                    what their actual problem was.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Initially, I thought this might be a principle, but as I considered it, I realised it was a variation
                    of <i>Understand the Problem</i>, where the real problem is in the mind of the questioner. But
                    there was something else here I thought, I felt like I couldn't just brush over it, I'd be missing out
                    on something insightful. I decided to create a mental model that I called Question Behind the Question,
                    and it goes like this. It's the idea that when someone asks you something, there's all this stuff
                    in their head that they haven't asked you, which is their actual problem, but they're asking you
                    what <i>they think</i> will get them the solution (this is a variation of information compression).
                    Can you see how this is a mental model? It's a simplifying assumption about how this particular piece of
                    the world works, if you keep that model in mind next time someone asks you to help them solve a problem, then you
                    will almost feel the nagging doubt that there's something else to this that they're not saying
                    which will hopefully prompt you to ask them more about the underlying reasons for their question.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Look at What was Done Previously.</b> In this lesson, the instructor made the point that you should go and look
                    at previous projects to see if this has been done before and if so, ask yourself what is
                    different now that wasn't the case back then. This was simply another principle and I captured it
                    as principle number four, <i>Don't Reinvent the Wheel.</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Consider Multiple Points of View</b>. In this lesson, the instructor made the point that
                    you should consider the problem from the point of view of different people, such as the sales team,
                    the CEO, the customer, or the engineering team. This will give you a new perspective on the problem.
                    It made sense I thought, and simply captured it as another principle, <i>Consider Different
                    Points of View</i>. I made a few notes as prompts: <i>What if Constraints were removed?</i>
                    <i>What does it look like from sales/ceo/engineering?</i>
                </p>
                <h3>Problem Solving Tools</h3>
                <p>
                    Section Three had the following sections.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Five Whys</p></li>
                    <li><p>Seven So-Whats</p></li>
                    <li><p>The 80-20 Rule</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <b>Five Whys.</b> The Five Whys is very simple, it involves asking <i>why</i> five times to get to the root
                    cause, what could be simpler than that. The instructor explained this in the first 30 seconds and
                    then went through an example. I thought great, another tool, specifically a tool for getting to
                    the root cause, so I connected it to the principle I captured earlier about <i>Evaluating the
                    Root Cause</i> and made a note to use the Five Whys to help you do it. Note that the number five
                    isn't to be taken literally, I assume it's there to give the tool a consistent name, and the
                    <i>Multiple Whys</i> didn't sound quite as catchy. The spirit of the tool is to keep asking
                    <i>Why</i> until you've got to the root cause.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Seven So Whats</b> The Seven So Whats is identical to the Five Whys except that you ask <i>What
                    happens as a result?</i> This time you do it seven times (presumably because five was already taken)
                    either way you're assessing consequences, not causes. Again, the idea is very
                    simple so I captured the tool in the first twenty seconds, the remainder of the ten-minute lesson
                    was just expounding on the idea with an example. I connected the tool to the <i>Evaluate the
                    Consequences</i> principle and made a note to use the tool to help.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Then something interesting happened.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a computer scientist by training, and I regularly
                    think in terms of cause and effect (that's basically what debugging is). As I watched the instructor
                    work through his examples of Five Whys and Seven So Whats, I watched him drill right down into a
                    very specific issue. Let me show you what happened (swapping in a different example).
                    The original issue was that the profit is declining. These are the five answers that came next.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>Problem. Our profit is going down.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Why? Because our product sales are declining.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Why? Because the product lacks critical features.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Why? Because the development team didn't have time to implement them.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Why? Because they were too busy fixing bugs in other products.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Why? Because there aren't enough team members to support the workload.</p></li>
                    <li><p>Result. We need to hire more developers.</p></li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    <i>Hang on??</i> I thought to myself. Things are never that simple. Are you absolutely sure
                    that the answers to each of those <i>why</i> questions is the one and only cause? There are probably lots
                    of reasons for plummeting profits. Something didn't feel right. At that point, the mental
                    models of graph theory and breadth vs depth-first search popped into my head. (These are mental models from
                    the field of computer science).
                </p>
                <p>
                    I realised that when you start at the problem and ask <i>why</i> for the first time, there are
                    multiple answers, and any one of them could be the cause. In reality, they probably all contribute
                    slightly. <i>You are in a tree, not a chain.</i> If you ask <i>why</i> again, you move up another
                    level in the tree, and because there is probably a high branching factor, you suddenly have a large number
                    of possible root causes. If you ask why <i>five times</i>, you could end up in a situation where
                    you have possibly hundreds of different root causes. How can we be so sure we've got the right one?
                    Once I realised this, I knew Five Whys could be dangerous if not used properly, because the reality
                    is that there is a tangled web of cause and effect leading to your original problem, and Five Whys
                    is a depth-first search down one path of the tree (as is Seven So Whats).
                </p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="../images/blogs/seriousactivereading/simple.png"/>
                    <p><i>Assumption made by Five Whys and Seven So-What's.</i></p>
                </div>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="../images/blogs/seriousactivereading/complex.png"/>
                    <p><i>The Reality</i></p>
                </div>

                <p>
                    The same applies to the consequences, it's a branching tree, not a chain. From this, I extracted
                    a new mental model, <i>The Cause and Effect Tree</i>. The model says that cause and effect are
                    complex, so be wary of pouring all of your efforts into a single root cause without being absolutely
                    sure it is the right one!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>The 80-20 Rule.</b> The 80-20 rule is the idea that 80% of the outputs come from 20% of the inputs.
                    This can be applied very widely, 80% of software bugs come from 20% of the features, 80% of the customer
                    support desk effort comes from 20% of the customers, etc. Sometimes people get stuck on the 80/20 split,
                    but it's just a power law, and it doesn't even have to add up to 100%. You can have 90% of your
                    problems coming from 1% of the customers etc. I already had this captured in my lists, it's a widely
                    known mental model that says cause and effect are usually disproportionately distributed. Something
                    always worth keeping in mind. The lesson itself introduced the rule and then showed a few examples,
                    I brushed over this one as I was already familiar with the concept.
                </p>
                <h3>Practice Problem Solving</h3>
                <p>
                    I'll admit, I was getting tired at this point,
                    the course had been going for almost an hour. I expected this section to be a wrap up of everything discussed
                    so far, so I turned down the turbo mode and relaxed a bit. I looked at the list of principles, mental models,
                    and tools that I'd got and watched the final section at about 30% effort, watching to see how and where these
                    principles and models were applied, but I didn't add anything new.
                </p>
                <h3>The Result</h3>
                <p>
                    Let's conclude. From a one-hour course on Problem Solving I extracted the following.
                </p>

                            <b>Principle: Evaluate the Root Cause.</b> Solve causes not consequences. Causes are a tree,
                            make sure you're considering the right ones. Break the problem into components. Use Five Whys
                            as a tool, and keep in mind the Cause and Effect Web.

                            why you're being asked to solve the problem. Consider Question Behind the Question. Use

                            or Engineering. What happens if you relax an assumption or constraint, what changes?

                            <b>Mental Model: Question Behind the Question</b> Says that when someone asks for your help
                            or asks you to solve a problem, they're not usually asking you to solve their problem, but
                            instead asking you to solve what they think is a sub-problem that will solve their problem.
                            If instead, you can find out what their true problem is, you might be able to sidestep the
                            issue and help them solve their problem directly. You might know something they don't.

                            <b>Mental Model: Cause and Effect Web.</b> Says that the causes for and consequences of
                            a particular problem are a messy and tangled web, it's probably not even directional,
                            no doubt that there are feedback loops and cycles. The model says, don't trust or rely
                            too much on a simplification, the reality is very complex, especially in organisations.

                            <b>Tool: Five Whys</b> A tool for exploring a causal chain of reasoning. Helps you
                            dive deeper into the cause part of the Cause and Effect Tree. Is like a depth-first
                            search. Be wary of not considering branches. Simply keep asking "Why". Five is arbitrary.

                            of not considering branches. Simply keep asking "So What". Seven is arbitrary.

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    I hope this post and the worked example was useful for you, this is my current method for
                    reading or learning new material, and I'm slowly building up those lists. No doubt I'll have to
                    adapt the process as I go, especially when those lists start getting very long, but it's working
                    well for the time being.
                </p>
                <p>
